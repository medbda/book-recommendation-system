# Hybrid book-recommendation-system



#Overview :

This project implements a Hybrid Book Recommendation System that combines Collaborative Filtering using ALS (Alternating Least Squares) and Content-Based Filtering using LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing).
The system leverages the strengths of both approaches — ALS captures user preferences from historical interaction data, while LSH finds similar books based on content features — to deliver accurate and diverse recommendations.
